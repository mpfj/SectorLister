# SectorLister

Simple system name generator for Elite Dangerous.

This tool generates an "ImportStars.txt" file that can be loaded into ED to pretend you've visited a whole sub-sector.
Useful when strip-mining or strip-hunting a sub-sector and you want to remove systems *not* in the sub-sector you're searching.
